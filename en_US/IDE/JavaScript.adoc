== Requirements

* SpaceVim
* tern
* tern_for_vim
* nodejs
* npm/cnpm

== Installation

=== SpaceVim

Make sure your SpaceVim is up-to-date.

=== Install `npm` or `cnpm`

Here are the examples:

*Arch:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo pacman -S npm nodejs
----

*Fedora:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf install npm nodejs
----

*Ubuntu:*

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install npm nodejs
----

=== Install `tern`

You have to install tern since https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim[tern_for_vim] using http://ternjs.net/[tern] as a server to provide auto-completion. (If I was wrong, please tell me. Because I am not a expert of nodejs)

Just Simply run:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/.cache/vimfiles/repos/github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim 
npm install tern
----

*Or*

[source,bash]
----
cnpm install tern
----

_PS: If you want to execute, please install `cnpm`._

=== Add config into your `~/.SpaceVim.d/init.vim`

[source,viml]
----
call SpaceVim#layers#load('lang#javascript')
----

And restart your vim to let SpaceVim itself to install plugins for you.

_If it takes a long time to install `tern_for_vim`, please install it manually by 3 steps below:_

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/.cache/vimfiles/repos/github.com/ternjs
$ git clone https://github.com/ternjs/tern_for_vim
$ cd tern_for_vim; npm install
----

== Config

The most important step is about how to configure your environment.

Actually, it’s pretty easy.

It has two optinos for config.

* Option A: `.tern-project`(in the current directory or one of the directories above that *for this project only*)
* Option B: `.tern-config`(*default* in your home directory)

*See more details http://ternjs.net/doc/manual.html#server[here]*

Here’s the example config:

[source,json]
----
{
  "plugins": {
    "node": {},
    "node_resolve": {},
    "es_modules": {},
    "modules": {}
  },
  "libs": [
    "browser",
    "ecma5",
    "ecma6",
    "react"
  ],
  "ecmaVersion": 6
}
----

*That’s it!!!*
