== Start to install

=== Install online

==== Check prerequisites

[arabic]
. git –version

The correct result✅： > git version 2.12.2.windows.2

[arabic, start=2]
. lua53 -v

The correct result✅： > Lua 5.3.3 Copyright (C) 1994-2016 Lua.org, PUC-Rio

[arabic, start=3]
. python -V

The correct result✅： > Python 3.6.1

[arabic, start=4]
. gvim

The correct result✅： > Opened a program

**Notice：If you happen to command not find, please install them correctly and set up your path correctly. See how to set up your path:**link:../FAQ.adoc#set-up-your-path[FAQ-Set up your PATH]

==== Start to install

[arabic]
. git clone https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim.git vimfiles
. Double-click Gvim’s icon, or open a new `cmd.exe` and execute `gvim`. Normally it should open a new terminal to clone `dein.vim`. As it shows below:

[arabic, start=3]
. SpaceVim will trigger downloading plugins mode(SpaceVim-v0.3.0 is so that). Wait to finish downloading plugins.

[arabic, start=4]
. Check whether your vim has `+Lua` and `+python` feature. Use `:version` to check out:

image:https://gist.github.com/Gabirel/b71a01cce86df216abd4fd0968864942/raw/1711e0d2ca9e22d8e3b4942498b0a77f9b25dd2c/vim-version-check.PNG[vim-version]

[arabic, start=5]
. Check whether your Lua and python2/3 really works by tow command: `echo has('lua')`, `echo has('python3')` and `echo has('python2')`
* Lua returns: 1
* Python returns: 1
* Python3 returns: 1

*Notice: `echo has('python2') and`echo has(`python3')`, only one of them returns`1`instead of returning`0` at the same time. This depends on vim.*

If `echo has('python2/3')` returns 0 both, check this: link:../FAQ.adoc#without-python-support[FAQ: Without-python-support]

[arabic, start=6]
. Install fonts, download fonts: https://github.com/wsdjeg/DotFiles/blob/master/fonts/DejaVu%20Sans%20Mono%20for%20Powerline.ttf[DejaVu Sans Mono for PowerLine.ttf].

After finishing installing fonts, your status bar should work very well.

[arabic, start=7]
. Fix `vimproc.dll error`. As it shows below:

image:https://gist.github.com/Gabirel/b71a01cce86df216abd4fd0968864942/raw/e7f27e84947f13bc9c91812881e47f2961162fc2/vimproc-dll-error.PNG[vimproc-dll]

https://github.com/Shougo/vimproc.vim/releases[Click me to download]. Copy it to: `C:\Users\<Your Name>\.cache\vimfiles\repos\github.com\Shougo\vimproc.vim\lib`

*Congratulations. You’are done!*

=== Install offline

==== Check prerequisites

List is the same as link:#check-prerequisites[Install online: Check prerequisites]. So I won’t repeat it:

* git
* lua
* python(2/3)
* gvim

==== Start to install

Still this part has the same introductions in link:#start-to-install-1[Install online: Start to install]. I will skip the same part. Only explain at different parts.

[arabic]
. git clone https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim.git vimfiles
. Extract the package to:

____
C:<Your Name>
____

dein.vim is the plugins manager of SpaceVim. It is downloaded automatically by starting gvim the first time. So you have to download it in advance.

*Notice: You could download the offline package. But we HIGHLY RECOMMEND packing it up by yourself to make sure that all plugins is up-to-date to make you more powerful.*

*For newbie: zip your `~/.cache/vimfiles` to packing SpaceVim*

[arabic, start=3]
. Open gvim to check out whether SpaceVim could start without any errors.

*Notice: Please make sure that vimproc_dll exists if you are using your own package.*

If you have `vimproc's dll`, please fix this according to the manual of link:#start-to-install-1[Install online: Start to install].

[arabic, start=4]
. Check whether gvim has lua and python’s full support, these steps are the same as link:#start-to-install-1[Install online: Start to install]
. Install fonts, download fonts *in advance*: https://github.com/wsdjeg/DotFiles/blob/master/fonts/DejaVu%20Sans%20Mono%20for%20Powerline.ttf[DejaVu Sans Mono for PowerLine.ttf].

After finishing installing fonts, the status bar should work very well.

*Congratulations! Install offline successfully!*

==== How can I update offline if I have no connection to the Internet?

As [@TamaMcGlinn](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn) mentions, https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle[`git bundle`] is suitable for incremental updates for plugins.

In this way, you don’t have to copy the whole plugins via *USB* or *internal email*.

Unfortunately, for all those plugins with `git bundle` method, you have to write scripts in order to incrementally update or load changes.

== Install Neovim

*Notice: You’ve entered the taboo areas.*

____
The sea of suffering is boundless; yet a turn of the gear is the other shore.
____

_Let’s go back to our shore [@wsdjeg]https://github.com/wsdjeg[wsdjeg] |:(_

[arabic]
. According to your own OS, select your version of https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#windows[Neovim]
. Add Neovim’s `bin` folder to your `PATH`
. Execute neovim
. If you are missing `vcruntime140.dll`, please https://www.dllme.com/dll/download/29939/vcruntime140.dll[click me to download]
. Install python2/python3 or both, which is allowed by Neovim
. Install full support of python of neovim:

* python2:

____
py -2 pip install –user –upgrade neovim
____

* python3:

____
py -3 pip install –user –upgrade neovim
____

[arabic, start=7]
. Execute neovim-qt.exe, and use `:CheckHealth` to check out whether your neovim supports python2/3. As results shows below:

With python2 support: image:https://gist.github.com/Gabirel/b71a01cce86df216abd4fd0968864942/raw/5aff57c9397cd26dba23dd0d81b94fa9cf061b56/nvim-python2-support-success.PNG[nvim-python2-support-success]

Without python3 support: image:https://gist.github.com/Gabirel/b71a01cce86df216abd4fd0968864942/raw/5aff57c9397cd26dba23dd0d81b94fa9cf061b56/nvim-python3-support-failure.PNG[nvim-python3-support-failure]

If you want to have python3 support, please install it according to step 6; Also, use commands suggested by neovim to have ruby support.

[arabic, start=8]
. Install SpaceVim

____
git clone https://github.com/SpaceVim/SpaceVim.git %userprofile% +
____

*Congratulations! You’ve installed it successfully.*

*Notice: Neovim doesn’t support lua(For now) in neovim-v0.2. So, SpaceVim uses deopelete for auto-completing code instead of neocomplete.*
