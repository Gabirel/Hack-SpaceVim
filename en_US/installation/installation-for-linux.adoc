==== Start to install

[arabic]
. Back up your own `.vimrc`. Just in case you don’t like SpaceVim
. Execute: `curl -sLf https://spacevim.org/install.sh | bash`
. Launch: vim

*After finishing downloading plugins, you installed SpaceVim successfully!*

[arabic, start=4]
. Check whether your vim has +Lua and +python feature. Use `vim --version | grep -E 'lua|python'` to check out:

*Notice: If your vim doesn’t have `+lua` and `+python` support, please install vim that has them or build vim from source.*

[arabic, start=5]
. Check whether your Lua and python2/3 really works by tow command: `echo has('lua')`, `echo has('python3')` and `echo has('python2')`
* Lua returns: 1
* Python returns: 1
* Python3 returns: 1

*Notice: `echo has('python2') and`echo has(`python3')`, both of them could return`1`instead of returning`0`.*

[arabic, start=6]
. Install fonts, download fonts *in advance*: https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono[DejaVu Sans Mono for PowerLine.ttf].

=== Install offline

==== Check prerequisites

List is the same as link:#check-prerequisites[Install online: Check prerequisites]. So I won’t repeat it:

* git
* lua
* python(2/3)
* vim/gvim

==== Start to install

Things are getting easier in SpaceVim-v0.9.0-dev. Yes, you can install SpaceVim without any Internet connection.

Try it!

[arabic]
. Download the release: https://github.com/Gabirel/Hack-SpaceVim/releases
. Extract the package to:

____
~
____

[arabic, start=3]
. Link the folder to vim:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir .vim
ln -svf ~/.SpaceVim/* ~/.vim/
----

[arabic, start=4]
. Open vim in your terminal and try it.

*Congratulations! Install offline successfully!*

==== How can I update offline if I have no connection to the Internet?

As https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn[@TamaMcGlinn] mentions, https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle[`git bundle`] is suitable for incremental updates for plugins.

In this way, you don’t have to copy the whole plugins via *USB* or *internal email*.

Unfortunately, for all those plugins with `git bundle` method, you have to write scripts in order to incrementally update or load changes.
