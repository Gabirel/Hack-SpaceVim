== FAQ

[qanda]
`init.toml` or `init.vim`?::

*TL;DR:* Choose `init.vim`. Don't use `init.toml`. + 
*Long answer:* Here are several reasons for this:
** SpaceVim doesn't provide detailed documents of variable name you can use. Under this circumstance, it is not smart to use `init.toml` although SpaceVim recommand you to use toml-style config. +
** You need nobody to tell you what variable name you can use in your vim script, just by looking up the source code of SpaceVim.
** *For beginner:* Toml-style of config won't help you develop skills related with vim script.
** In order to define your custom code/functions, you have to use https://spacevim.org/documentation/#bootstrap-functions[bootstrap functions]. You will then pollute SpaceVim's source code.

What does `Hack-SpaceVim` really do?::
Currently, it is trying to be something really useful to whom wants to master or use SpaceVim, including various aspects. Not just SpaceVim, but also vim/nvim.
